so, what did we learn ?
generate random numbers
Basic javaFX application along with the main. controller. and the layout .fxml
we learn how to hookup the components and how to react to all sort of events


compile:
Rotems-iMac:maman11_sectionB roeyHonig$ javac -d out src/student/honig/roey/DrawShapes.java src/student/honig/roey/DrawShapesController.java
Rotems-iMac:maman11_sectionB roeyHonig$ java -cp out:/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_191.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/* student.honig.roey.DrawShapes
!important you need to remeber to manually copy the fxml file too
